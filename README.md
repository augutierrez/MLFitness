# MLFitness
Authors : Antonio Gutierrez and Keeven Savanathan
A machine learning project project for our USF CS 486-04 Machine Learning class.

The goal of MLFitness is to classify a good squat or bad squat.
We created data and got some off Google.  
We classified a good squat based on the depth and safety of it (if back was rounded or not).

Our program calculates angles based off the points of major joints predicted from each photo using Human Pose Estimation.

We referenced code from: https://github.com/kunjshah2511/Human-Pose-Estimation
Many thanks!
